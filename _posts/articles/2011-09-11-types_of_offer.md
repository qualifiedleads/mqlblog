> Few things will change conversion rates as the type of Offer you make people.

Offers come in all shapes and sizes, and just going to your local supermarket on a regular basis will open your eyes to the many different types of offer there are.

And yes, these are all translatable to B2B also. And they definitely also work with the most sophisticated of clientele. Doctors, Lawyers, Accountants, High-Court judges, Heart-Surgeons, etc.

Whatever image you have of a “sophisticated client”, ideas of offers, stolen from your local supermarket will increase your marketing. Let’s see how:

Types of offer, among others

*   Gift-with-Purchase
*   “$1 dollar, 7-day unlimited trial”
*	“Free, unlimited sign-up”
*	“Free in return for a Case Study”
*	“No credit-card Trial”
*	Yearly subscription $12,000, at $9,997
*	Net-30
*	Preferred Customer Club Discount
*	One-Time-Offer
*	Let’s dissect some of these a little more:

##“Gift-with-Purchase”

New Relic recently made  a "Gift-with-Purchase" offer
We’ve all seen this in the supermarket, but as New Relic shows here, this type of offer is perfectly usable in B2B.


##“$1 dollar, 7-day unlimited trial”.

Designed to get you actually using the product. The $1 is only designed to remove the absolute worst tire-kickers.

##“Free, unlimited sign-up”
You are giving away everything, and you leave out mentioning that it is for a limited time. Another version is Free, but limited (access, usage, …)

##“Free in return for a Case Study”
When starting-up, it’s really important to get credibility ASAP. Pulling in some big brands can go a long way to getting you in the door with paying customers. the thinking is: “…if they are using it, it must be something I Need / Can Trust / etc”

##“No credit-card Trial”
Here you are overcoming the barrier of having to enter-in credit card details on a web-form. Some people are still wary of buying on-line, but with the main credit card companies providing very strict return-policies and insurance against fraud, the main objection is mostly “can’t be bothered to fill-out a web-form” laziness.

##“Yearly subscription $1,299, at $997″
It’s a discount, pure and simple. But testing this is important, as it can make a big difference to your bottom line.

##“Net-30″
Means: You get to use it for free for one month and I will ‘net’ the profit at the end of that month.

##“Preferred Customer Club discount”
This involves offering a limited time to join the “Preferred customer Club”. Joining costs nothing, but it benefits the person with a discount.
However, the discount is already factored-in and is only designed to keep the customer on an auto-renewal, charging their credit card on a monthly basis.

This type of offer can make it so that you don’t need to break-even on the first transaction. Obviously you need to do your arithmetic first before deploying this on a large scale.

##“One-Time-Offer”

Usually effective when someone has made a small purchase, and then before he leaves, presenting an incredible discount that you explain he will only be offered once. This has the benefit of “training” the newly acquired customer into obeying your instructions – even when he doesn’t take you up on this special offer.

## Birthday discount
Using proper list selects, dividing you list in to 12 and offering someone a discount to "Celebrate their birthday" will work better than not doing such a segmentation. Obviiulsy this would mean you either had access to that data, or it was a house-list.
