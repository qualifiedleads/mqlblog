Rocket Fuel's webinar about traffic quality, covering four types of suspect traffic: 'ad-stacking'; bots & botnets; toolbars and impression laundering systems.
It includes an introduction to their new [Traffic Scanner:](https://trafficscanner.rocketfuel.com "RocketFuel's free bot detection system")
To test your traffic quality you can use their free pixel and view the results in the dashboard. As RocketFuel is an agency, formerly known as "X+1", they obviously have a vested interest in tracking your traffic too. So possibly this could be a conflict of interest for some advertisers.
Check your similarweb, or WRW if you're worried, but don't ignore the value of their tool entirely. There are some other free tools to detect bot traffic, and some very expensive ones. The subject is not an easy one to fix.
