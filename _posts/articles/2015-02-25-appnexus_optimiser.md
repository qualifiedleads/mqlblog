I was recently made aware of an optimisation feature inside AppNexus, entitled: “Optimise to a predicted CPC goal”. I have yet to try it for my own campaigns, but from all reports it works quite well.

What it does is help you find placements that can get you a click for a **CPC that you want, while paying CPM!**
Example: you’d like to get clicks at $0.25. You set aside a budget for AppNexus to try and get you those clicks - **at a CPM rate that you set.**

This feature works best when you are targeting a sizable audience. So, using it in the US makes it work very nicely. If targeting a country/geo with a smaller population then it may take too long to actually learn anything.
So , you would have to increase the budget allocated to learning to speed up the process and actually get some results.

*To use, set the following:*

	1. set a daily budget
	2. check: “Buy Third-Party inventory”
	3. check “pay on a CPM basis”
	4. from the dropdown select “Optimise to a predicted CPC goal”
	5. set a Campaign budget, eg “Media Cost” $2000
	6. set a daily “learning cap”

####What is a “daily learning cap”?
It’s the amount you set aside for the optimisation algorithm to calculate & test. It will attempt to find placements/sites that can get you a CPC that you want to get.

So, even though you’re still bidding on a CPM rate, you effectively pay CPC. Pretty snazzy tool.
